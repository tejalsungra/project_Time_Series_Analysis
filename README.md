# Time-Series Analysis
This project is about forecasting of data over time. In time series the data poins are collected over a period of time. The period of time could be Years, Months, Weeks, Days, Horus, Minutes, and Seconds and time is often an independent variable.
Time series is an essential for forecasting and predicting time based series. This is helpful in determinig trends and pattern from the historical event.
## Steps to Analyze Time-Series

1. Collecting and preparing data for the analysis. Setting date time index.
2. Creating the plot datetime vs the target coloumn.<br/>
3. Check whether the data is stationary.<br/>
4. Developing charts using rolling window to understand the data pattern.<br/>
5. Applying Dickey Fullers test to see for the stationary series.<br/>
6. If data is not stationary apply differencing (d)  to make series stationary.<br/>
7. Find values of p and q by plotting pacf and acf curve.<br/>
8. Implementing the ARIMA model.<br/>
9. Forecasting of values from the best fit ARIMA model.<br/>
